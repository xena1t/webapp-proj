                <h2>Built by enthusiasts</h2>
                <p>TechMart began as a collective of engineers and designers frustrated by compromises in off-the-shelf gear. We
                    set out to curate components and devices we would trust for our own rigs, and we extend that same standard to
                    every product we recommend today.</p>

                <h2>Crafted for every workflow</h2>
                <p>From rendering multi-cam edits to chasing the latest esports metas, our team partners with leading brands to
                    assemble hardware that is ready for work and ready to play. Each drop is benchmarked, tuned, and supported by
                    specialists who understand the demands of modern creators.</p>
